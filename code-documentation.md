## Food Web Lists & Variables

### Variables Description
- **Names** (`List<string>`): Stores the names of animals or food items.
- **Eats** (`List<string>`): Lists the prey or food each animal consumes. Multiple values seperated by ,
- **Quantity** (`List<float>`): Represents the population or quantity of each item in `Names`.
- **EatsHowMany** (`List<float>`): The amount of food each animal requires per day.
- **DeathsPerDay** (`List<float>`):  How many die per day
- **Replication** (`List<float>`): Births per day
- **Multiplier** (^(`List<float>`): (like 0.56% for a 56% chance for the max deads or replicates per day)

## Database.cs

### Class: Database
This class is responsible for handling data persistence, including reading and saving the state of the food web.

#### Methods
- **OpenDatabase** `(string filePath)`: Reads the save file located at `filePath`. Returns all the above lists.
- **SaveToDatabase** `(List<string> Names, List<string> GetsEatenBy, List<string> Eats, List<float> Quantity, List<float> EatsHowMany, List<bool> FoodOrEater, string filePath)`: Saves the current state to a file located at `filePath`.

## OperationHelper.cs

### Class: OperationHelper
This class contains functions to perform operations like sorting the food web layers.

#### Methods
- Function: SortByLayer
   This function organizes the food web elements into hierarchical layers based on their trophic levels (i.e., their position in the food chain).

   Input Parameters
   - Lists of `Names`, `GetsEatenBy`, `Eats` and `FoodOrEater`.

   Output
   - **LayerIndexes** (`List<int>`): A list of indexes representing the sorted order of elements as per their trophic layers.
   - **LayerBoundaries** (`List<int>`): A list indicating the end index within `LayerIndexes` for each trophic layer.

   Example
   Suppose we have the following input data:

   - **Names**: [Plant, Rabbit, Fox, Grasshopper, Snake]
   - **GetsEatenBy**: [Rabbit, Fox, "", Grasshopper, Fox]
   - **Eats**: ["", Plant, Rabbit, Plant, Grasshopper]

   After applying `SortByLayer`, we might get the following output:

   - **LayerIndexes**:

  | Index | Value |
  |-------|-------|
  | 0     | 3     |
  | 1     | 0     |
  | 2     | 1     |
  | 3     | 4     |
  | 4     | 2     |

   - **LayerBoundaries**:

  | Index | Value |
  |-------|-------|
  | 0     | 2     |
  | 1     | 4     |
  | 2     | 5     |


   Explanation
   - **LayerIndexes**: This shows that Grasshopper (index 3) and Plant (index 0) are at the bottom of the food chain (producers). Rabbit (index 1) and Snake (index 4) are the next level (primary consumers), and Fox (index 2) is a secondary consumer.
   - **LayerBoundaries**: Indicates the division of trophic levels. The first two elements (indices 0 and 3) are producers, the next two (indices 1 and 4) are primary consumers, and the last one (index 2) is a secondary consumer.

- Function: GetLayer
  This Function gives you back only the Layer you requested.

  Input Parameters:
  - **LayerIndexes**: The first output from the Helper Function `SortByLayer`
  - **LayerBoundaries**: The second output from the Helper Function `SortByLayer`
  - **Layer Number**: The Layer you want back: Layers start by 1.

  Output:
  - `List<int>`: Lists all the items from the requested Layer. It will give an empty List back if the layer doesnt exist.

- Function: InputValidation
  This Functions checks if all the values are correct so there isnt an error when try to render it.

  NOTE: This doesnt check yet if the parameters to run a simulation are also correct.

  Input Parameters:
  - Lists of `Names`, `GetsEatenBy`, `Eats` and `FoodOrEater`.

  Output:
  - **Boolean**: true if everything is ok. false if there is an error.
  - **string**: if Bool is false it will give an error message what is wrong.
